Well, the place I enjoy 
the most is a small town located in France. I 
like this small town because it has very charming 
ocean view. I mean the sky there is so blue and 
the beach is always full of sunshine. You know 
how romantic it can ever be, just relax yourself 
on the beach, when the sun is setting down, when 
the ocean breeze is blowing and the seabirds are 
singing. Of course I like this small French town 
also because there are many great French restaurants. 
They offer the best seafood in the world 
like lobsters and tuna fishes. The most important, 
I have been benefited a lot from this trip 
to France because I made friends with some gorgeous 
French girls. One of them even gave me a 
little watch as a souvenir of our friendship.
