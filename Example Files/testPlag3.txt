West Indies appear to be a popular side to plan a swansong against. Less than four years on from the two-Test series they played in India - more famous for being Sachin Tendulkar's last series than anything else - Pakistan's Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan have decided they, too, will bid farewell to international cricket once the upcoming three Tests against Jason Holder's men are concluded.
As such, the focus is largely on the visiting side, and the statistical minutiae of what the pair might be able to do over these three games. When will Younis complete 10,000 Test runs? Will Misbah finally reverse a trend that has seen Pakistan lose six Test matches in a row, a run that began against these very opponents in Sharjah last year? Will Pakistan finally win their maiden Test series in the Caribbean? Heck, will Younis stick to his retirement decision this time?
There isn't any such context or grand meaning to the West Indies angle. At best, they can build on a somewhat encouraging performance during the ODIs, and their younger players can polish their credentials in the longest format of the game. A series win would mark their seemingly umpteenth turnaround, a word that apparently so frustrates West Indies cricket fans Fazeer Mohammed said it had been banned right across the Caribbean.
However, what has quietly gone unnoticed while everyone vies for the most melancholic tribute to Misbah and Younis is that a decidedly second-string West Indies side dominated Pakistan during a three-day tour match. The retiring duo combined for 15 runs, while Pakistan's spin king Yasir Shah registered figures of 53-3-189-3 across both innings. The West Indies President's XI took a lead of 227 runs and came away with a fair degree more credibility than the international opposition.
