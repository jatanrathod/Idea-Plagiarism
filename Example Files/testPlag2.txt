Well, 
I prefer to return to places I have already visited. 
Uh I still remember the experience that I went to 
a small British town located by the by the beach. 
The scenery is so beautiful. Uh I mean the sky 
there is very blue and the ocean is always full 
of sunshine. How romantic it can ever be, just 
relax yourself on the beach when the sun is setting 
down, the sea breeze is blowing and the sea 
birds are singing. I also want to go back there because 
I met several gorgeous British girls there. 
Uh we developed consolid-, we developed a solid 
uh friendships and they even gave me a present uh 
to cherish our friendships.
